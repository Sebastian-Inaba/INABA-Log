## About This Project

INABA-Log is a **personal blog** designed to document coding projects, case studies, and my thoughts. It supports Markdown(haven't decided on library) for content creation, allowing clean posts and research entries. The project is built with a modern **MERN + TypeScript stack** and styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive and interactive experience.

**Tech Stack:**
(for now)
* **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js + Express + TypeScript
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **Other Libraries:** react-router-dom, react-markdown(maybe)

**Key Features:**

* Full **CRUD** for blog posts and research entries
* Categorize posts
* Markdown support for all posts and research
* Highlighted or featured posts
* Search and filtering
* Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
* Admin panel for secure content management

### Progress Updates

- Post and research(deep dives) GET route in backend tested and working

- Admin backend still being altered and tested, having trouble with including PDF's logic in to the code and images stopped being deleted on replacement even tho they worked when i started testing. 

- Testing is taking a bit longer then i expected, its the first time im trying full testing from backend without any frontend implementation. Also google auth 2.0 was to annoying to test with there playground so i just ended up disabling id_token and using access_token directly from postman to do testing. 

#### Full Design Example (might not be final product)

- The design is thought out to be simple to navigate with no big distraction from the users
- However I wanted a dark theme design with allot of different colors to highlight content
- Right now I'm playing around with a lot of different colors and they are a bit distracting
