### Progress Updates

# Update

- I’ve been procrastinating the launch of the website because I always feel it’s not quite ready and there’s always something small I can fix. But I think it’s time. Next steps will be to create some initial posts, maybe a dive deeper, and then host it.

- Once it’s hosted, I’ll start tackling some of the bigger tasks, like SEO and WCAG accessibility, server-side pagination, signed URLs, Google Analytics, and more. There’s still a lot to do, but this is a solid start.

#### Full Design Example (might not be final product)

- The design is thought out to be simple to navigate with no big distraction from the users
- However I wanted a dark theme design with allot of different colors to highlight content
- Right now I'm playing around with a lot of different colors and they are a bit distracting
