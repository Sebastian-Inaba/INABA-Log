* **Database:** MongoDB * Supabase
* **Other Tools:** react-router-dom, cookie-parser, prettier, axios react-markdown(maybe)

**Key Features:**

* Full **CRUD** for blog posts and research entries
* Categorize posts
* Markdown support for all posts and research
* Highlighted or featured posts
* Search and filtering
* Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
* Admin panel for secure content management

### Progress Updates

- Fixed new post detail page which fetches post data via slug

- Also added a featured posts component that will also be used on the posts page

#### Full Design Example (might not be final product)

- The design is thought out to be simple to navigate with no big distraction from the users
- However I wanted a dark theme design with allot of different colors to highlight content
- Right now I'm playing around with a lot of different colors and they are a bit distracting
