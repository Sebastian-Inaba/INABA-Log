## About This Project

INABA-Log is a **personal blog** designed to document coding projects, case studies, and my thoughts. It supports Markdown(haven't decided on library) for content creation, allowing clean posts and research entries. The project is built with a modern **MERN + TypeScript stack** and styled with **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive and interactive experience.

**Tech Stack:**
(for now)
* **Frontend:** React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
* **Backend:** Node.js + Express + TypeScript
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **Other Libraries:** react-router-dom, react-markdown(maybe)

**Key Features:**

* Full **CRUD** for blog posts and research entries
* Categorize posts
* Markdown support for all posts and research
* Highlighted or featured posts
* Search and filtering
* Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
* Admin panel for secure content management

### Progress Updates

- Set up most of the backend except routes (not tested)

- Things that need to be done in backend: field selection for the get controllers, route setup and then test everything, CRUD, auth, file handling, middlewares, filtering, etc...

#### Full Design Example (might not be final product)

- The design is thought out to be simple to navigate with no big distraction from the users
- However I wanted a dark theme design with allot of different colors to highlight content
- Right now I'm playing around with a lot of different colors and they are a bit distracting
